      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        The Virtual Vietnam Memorial is a project by Willie Chalmers III to
        dedicate the lives of those fallen in the Vietnam War.
      </p>
      <p>
        After reading <i>The Things They Carried</i> by Tim O'Brien, a man who
        served in the Vietnam War, my AP English Language class began a project
        to honor the fallen soldiers in the Vietnam War: we'd all make videos
        about a solider we chose, whether because he was an interesting man
        all-around or he had some personal connection to one of us.

        I immediately thought about how I'd present my soldier, but I remembered
        an unfortunate part of the presentation process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The time it takes between presentations leaves a lot of room to forget.
        How come is it, in 2018, that sharing multimedia presentations is
        difficult not only for the teacher, but for the student?

        Yes, there's <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>,
        but not everyone wishes to upload their school projects to YouTube. Many
        students and teachers would rather have students bring in a flash drive
        anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what about after the presentations? Are they lost forever? Why
        can't they be preserved for those interested souls well beyond our
        presentation days? Why does remembering have to stop after we get a
        grade for a project?
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came this idea a few minutes later: the idea of a virtual memorial.
        In this virtual memorial, students could upload their videos to a trusted
        site anyone could use for more than just a single presentation.
      </p>
      <p>I went ahead and built this in a day because, as Tim O'Brien said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>In a story, miracles can happen.</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        And in this case, I intend to preserve the stories of the fallen in a
        manner in which I know how.
